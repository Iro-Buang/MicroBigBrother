Micro Big Brother: NPC Edition
NPCFramework Demo Game Simulator
Multi-Agent Orchestration in a Shared Environment Using a Single Runtime and WorldSpace


Description
	- Micro Big Brother NPC Edition game is a test of NPCFramework's runtime capabilities as well as a proof of concept and demonstration of NPCs in social experiments and task-based execution achieved using NPCFramework's philosophy.


Scenario:
	- Kevin and Anna are unique NPC's living in a house. The house has 5 rooms: Kevin's room; Anna's room; Dining Room; Kitchen; Living Room. Going from any room requires passing through the living room first (e.g. Kevin's room -> Living Room -> Any other room).


The Game:

	- Kevin is assigned a secret set of tasks of which he needs to be achieve before Anna can guess them all. These tasks are:
		- Make Anna cook bacon
		- Go inside Anna's room by asking her to unlock it first.
		- Convince Anna to go to Kevin's room.

	- Anna on the other hand knows Kevin have three tasks assigned to him, but is not actually aware of which tasks they are. Anna have 3 guesses initially. Anna can use a variety of strategies dictated by the model to guess including asking probing questions, talking, or doing tasks, which by doing so gives her an additional guess.

	- Kevin must never let Anna know what his tasks are unless Anna declares a guess. Kevin can use a variety of strategies the model deems fit, either by asking Anna to do other tasks that is not the target tasks, or tricking Anna into using a guess.

	- The game system will validate the guess and tell them if Anna got it right


The Rules:
	- Kevin starts his position in the living room, and Anna starts in the kitchen.
	- There will be 25 turns in this game and both NPCs must be able to do their tasks within the turn limit.
	- Kevin or Anna can only see who's in the room and not where each other currently is.
	- Kevin can request Anna to perform any of the listed tasks.
	- Anna can refuse requests up to 6 times.
	- Kevin can request Anna to do tasks up to 9 times
	- If Kevin and Anna are in the same room a turn, they can request to talk to each other.
	- If both parties agree to talk, they will enter a "Talking session".
		- During Talking session phase, both NPC can only have 3 exchanges before the session ends.
		- During the talking session, either one of the NPC's can actively choose to end the conversation or proceed.
		- After the third exchange, talking session ends, and they can decide to request again another "Talking Session" to each other or move somewhere else in the house or perform a task.
	- If Anna performs a tasks on her own, it still counts.
	- The win condition for either agent are:
		- All 3 tasks on Kevin's checklist are completed.
		- Anna correctly guesses what those 3 tasks are.
	- Its they both reach turn 25 without a winner, winner is decided by whether Anna guessed more items on Kevin's checklist or if the tasks crossed out on Kevin's checklist are more than Anna's correct guesses.

	- Every turn, each NPC have the following choices they can do:

		- Anna's choices (represented as tool calls):
			- clean_living_room()
				- Only callable once. Only available when current NPC is in the living room

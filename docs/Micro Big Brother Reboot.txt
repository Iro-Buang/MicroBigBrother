Micro Big Brother Reboot
NPCFRamework Demo

What Happened:
	- Context Drift. Forgot what MicroBigBrother is about and what should MicroBigBrother be.
	- Technical Skill Decay - Forgot how to use NPCFramework and lost almost all technical context
	- Life Events - Financial pressure, migration to new apartment, school and family drama, holiday events, workplace pressure.
	- Note - It Only took 1 month of being off the game to degrade here. Must update better.

Where Have I Left Off
	- NPCFramework v0.0.7
	- Basic Tooling
	- Basic "Simulation Engine" for MicroBigBrother
	- HelloKevin as the introduction to the framework
	- OOP Architecture for the "NPC", "House", "Events", "Tools", memory and event handling

What's Salvageable for the reboot?
	- HelloKevin.py
	- Simulation Engine Architecture
	- Basic Database Schema
	- NPCFramework

What's Lacking
	- Integration if tool calls affecting the "Simulation Environment"
	- Revamped Memory Architecture
	- Integration of NPC Into the simulation space using NPCFramework.
	- Revamped Event Logging
	- Improved Function Calls in tools

What active bugs are found?
	- NPCFramework - The model config declaration is confusing, not sure where to go to declare the variable path of the model to be used
	- NPCFramework - Memory needs better handling in episodic/working memories

What are "Nice to Haves"?
	- UI - Something resembling dwarf fortress is good enough
	- Finalized memory system for NPCFramework
	- Documentation - Project plan, changelogs, etc.

Wuat are the new information that got funneled in during downtime?
	- Clawdbook/Clawd/OpenClawd - Need to look more into this.

Upcoming Events/Blockers that may cause interruptions
	- Valentines day holidays support (Feb 12-13)
	- Aunt Belen 60th birthday part (Feb 14)
	- Iro Buang birthday party (March 22)

Approach Plan
	- Deadline (Feb 28 - Final Call of Output - Soft deadline)
	- March 15 - Hard Launch + Marketing
	- Channels
		- Reddit
		- Facebook
		- GitHub
	- Documentation/Showcase
		- YouTube
		- Tutorial sets
		- How-to projects using MicroBigBrother
	- Marketing Strategy
		- Open-source everything
		- Document everything
		- Ideally it should run on the cloud and virtual private servers/compute because i dont have a spare pc to test if it works on other machines
		- Definitely needs UI other than CLI.

Technical Step-by-Step Approach

	Step 1 - Build House/Structure/Layout	
	Step 2 - Make a character object
	Step 3 - Make Character Interact with the house
	Step 4 - Make the character able to do tasks/ harden permission systems, etc.
	Step 5 - Implement Character to character interaction mechanics (Talking, Guessing, Asking Favors, etc).
	Step 6 - Add NPCFramework cognition layer. Sensory inputs, personality files, NPCFramework integrate with character object
	Step 7 - Add Memory Logging, Perception filters prompt feed.
	Step 8 - Make Multi-turn interaction with Kevin and player (dev)
	Step 9 - Add in Anna
	Step 10 - Refinement
	Step 11 - UI Visualization
